# Qf-store
Heavily heavily inspired by NERDTree.  
I mean I admit totally copy-and-pasted some codes. No offence, forgive me!

## Feature

- qf-store-window
  - open/close qf-store
  - sort out the store
    - name
    - added at
  - Jump to the file
  - Delete item

- normal mode
  - add current qf lists to qf-store
  - add item

- TBD
  - Group function
    - write the content out to the file, and load them
      - ~/.qf-store/

## Todo
- rename variables and methods naming cases to snake case
